# Pathfinder

Pathfinder is a open source desktop app that offers a visualizer for different pathfinding algorithms.

## Tech used

This app is fully written in `rust`. For GUI, I've used [druid](https://github.com/linebender/druid).

## Motivation

Working on this project helps me practice both `rust` and `druid`
